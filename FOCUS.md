## Project Overview

### Project Name: Social Media Outreach Extension

### Description:
This project involves developing a Chrome extension designed to assist users in generating responses to social media content. The extension allows users to paste any social media link, analyze the content, and generate a response based on an emoji that reflects their sentiment.

### Key Features:
1. **Link Input**: Users can paste any social media link into the extension.
2. **Content Review**: The extension analyzes the content of the link.
3. **Emoji-Based Response**: Generates a response based on the user's selected emoji.
4. **Quick Copy Functionality**: Provides a button to quickly copy the generated response for easy pasting into social media platforms.
5. **Session Tracking**: Tracks the number of outreach sessions per day.
6. **Data Export**: Allows users to download session data as a JSON file for analysis.

### Technical Requirements:
- **Programming Languages**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
- **AI Integration**: Requires integration with an AI or machine learning model for content analysis and response generation.
- **CORS Considerations**: Must handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing policies when fetching content from external sites.
- **Storage**: Uses Chrome's storage API to store session data.

### Goals:
- **Flexibility**: Allow users to work with any social media platform.
- **Ease of Use**: Provide a simple and intuitive interface for users to generate and copy responses.
- **Sentiment-Based Responses**: Use emojis to reflect user sentiment in generated responses.
- **Data Analysis**: Enable users to track and analyze their outreach activity over time.

### Challenges:
- **Content Access Restrictions**: Some social media platforms may restrict direct access to their content.
- **AI Complexity**: Integrating AI for content analysis and response generation can be complex.
- **Data Privacy**: Ensure that stored session data is secure and private.

### Implementation Steps:
1. **Manifest File**: Update the `manifest.json` to include necessary permissions for accessing external content and using Chrome's storage API.
2. **Popup UI**: Design a simple popup where users can input links, select emojis, and download session data.
3. **JavaScript Logic**: Write JavaScript code to fetch content, analyze it using AI, generate responses based on emojis, track sessions, and provide a quick copy feature.
4. **Data Export Functionality**: Implement a function to export session data as a JSON file.
