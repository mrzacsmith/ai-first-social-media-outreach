# Description: Enforce coding standards and best practices for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

## HTML Guidelines
- Use semantic HTML5 elements (e.g., `<header>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`).
- Ensure all `<img>` tags have descriptive `alt` attributes.
- Validate HTML to ensure it adheres to W3C standards.

## CSS Guidelines
- Utilize Flexbox or CSS Grid for layout designs.
- Use BEM (Block Element Modifier) naming convention for class names.
- Avoid inline styles; prefer external CSS files for styling.
- Ensure responsive design principles are followed for various screen sizes.

## JavaScript Guidelines
- Write ES6+ syntax, including `let` and `const` for variable declarations.
- Prefer arrow functions for anonymous function expressions.
- Use template literals (`\``) for string concatenation.
- Implement modules to organize code into reusable components.
- Include JSDoc comments for functions and classes to enhance readability.

## General Best Practices
- Maintain consistent indentation (e.g., 2 spaces per level).
- Keep line length under 80 characters for better readability.
- Regularly run linters (e.g., ESLint for JavaScript, stylelint for CSS) to enforce code quality.
- Ensure cross-browser compatibility for all features.
- Optimize assets (images, fonts) to improve page load performance.
